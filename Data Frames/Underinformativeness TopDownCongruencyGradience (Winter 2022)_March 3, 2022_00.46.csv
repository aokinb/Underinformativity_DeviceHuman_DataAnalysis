Investigator: Dr. Georgia Zellou, Assistant Professor of Linguistics, University of California, Davis



Why am I being invited to take part in a research study? 

We invite you to take part in a research study because you have agreed to participate in the psychology subjects pool. 



Who can I talk to?

If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think the research has hurt you, talk to the Principal Investigator, Dr. Georgia Zellou. Phone: 561-252-0014; Office: 268 Kerr Hall, University of California, Davis.



This research has been reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (""IRB""). Information to help you understand research is on-line at http://www.research.ucdavis.edu/IRBAdmin. You may talk to a IRB staff member at (916) 703-9151, IRBAdmin@ucdmc.ucdavis.edu, or 2921 Stockton Blvd, Suite 1400, Room 1429, Sacramento, CA 95817 for any of the following: 

Your questions, concerns, or complaints are not being answered by the research team. 

You cannot reach the research team. 

You want to talk to someone besides the research team. 

You have questions about your rights as a research subject. 

You want to get information or provide input about this research. 



 

Why is this research being done? 

This research is about the sounds of spoken language. This study has two main purposes: First, to examine the ways in which speakers pronounce various sounds may differ from word to word or depending on context. Second, to analyze the effects of some of these details of pronunciation on listeners. The hypothesis proposed for this study is that the details present in the sounds of spoken language are controllable by speakers and perceptible to listeners of that language. 



How long will the research last? 

We expect you will be in this research study for 30 minutes. 



How many people will be studied? 

We expect about 1000 people will participate in this research study. 



What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?

If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to listen to words words played over a computer and provide a simple response about what you heard, for instance, whether it was a real word or a nonsense word or which of two pronunciations sounds better to you. You will make your response as quickly as possible by choosing one of two options. You will be asked to take a questionnaire and a demographics form. You have been asked to participate because you are a native speaker of the language we are studying. You responses will be confidential. 



What happens if I do not want to be in this research?

You may decide not to take part in the research and it will not be held against you. 



What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later? 

You can choose whether or not to be in  this study. If you consent to be in this study, you may withdraw at any time without consequences of any kind. You may also refuse to answer any questions or participate in any procedure for any reason. Neither participation nor non-participation will affect your evaluation in any course either positively or negatively. 



What happens to the information collected for research? 

Although nothing in our data should be sensitive in nature, we will make every effort to maintain the privacy of our data. You will not be identified in any published or presented work, and your recorded data will be identified only by a participant index number. A list of the mapping between index numbers and participants' names will be stored separately from the data. We cannot promise complete confidentiality. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other University of California representatives responsible for the management or oversight of this study.
